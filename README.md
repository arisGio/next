Studying NextJS from the official documentation

## from js to react

- dom of page differs from source code in browser dev tools
- html reps initial page content
- BUT DOM reps UPDATED PAGE CONTENT changed by JS

## jsx

- js xml
- 3 rules
- return single root element
- close all the tags
- camelCase most of the things

## babel

- type=text/jsx
- inform babel what code to transform

## imperative vs declarative

- comparing previous js with current react code difference is huge
- do not forget the essence here regarding DOM and source code
- relevant for SSR later on

## components

- should be capitalized
- use angle brackets < >
